Mandatory assignment from second semester in my freshmen year. 
Basic programming in html, css, php and some javascript. The task was to build an app to register and keep track of students in different classes. 
Not much effort into css since php and working towards a db was the main point about the assignment and the course overall. 
This small application includes functionality for CRUD operations towards a db.
